# ⭐ STAR - Secure Transformer-based Adult-content Recognition

**STAR (Secure Transformer-based Adult-content Recognition)** is an advanced AI model designed for multi-label classification of adult content using deep learning techniques. Built on a **Swin Transformer** backbone, STAR aims to provide secure and explainable detection of explicit content while ensuring ethical AI deployment.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-label Classification**: Detects and categorizes adult content into multiple subcategories.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Integrates **Class Activation Mapping (CAM)** for visual interpretability.
- **Secure & Ethical**: Designed with responsible AI principles to prevent misuse.
- **Transformer-based Architecture**: Utilizes **Swin Transformer** for high accuracy in image classification.

## 📌 Content Classification

The model categorizes images into the following **main categories**, each with its respective **subcategories (tags):**

| **Main Category**   | **Subcategories (Tags)** |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Adult**          | `in_bikini`, `bra_exposed`, `panty_exposed`, `breast_exposed`, `vagina_exposed`, `butt_exposed`, `penis_exposed` |
| **Real Nude**      | `celebrity_nude`, `celebrity_movie`, `boudior`, `cp_nude` |
| **Fake Nude**      | `celebrity_fake`, `cp_fake`, `revenge_porn`, `loan_app_defamation` |
| **Pornographic**   | `masturbating`, `kissing`, `intercourse`, `oral`, `professional_porn`, `leaked_videos`, `amateur_porn` |
| **Artistic**       | `painting`, `statue`, `digital_art`, `ai_gen` |
